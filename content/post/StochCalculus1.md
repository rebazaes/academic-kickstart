This is the first chapter about stochastic calculus. In this first part, we concentrate on stochastic processes. In particular, we define the concepts of stopping times, Markov processes and quadratic variation. Finally, we also consider two important stochastic processes: Brownian motion and Poisson processes.\\
The notes are based on the lectures notes "Basics of stochastic analysis" of Timo Seppäläinen. I also expect to publish the solutions of some exercises in this text.\\
