In this sixth part of the Stochastic Calculus series, we study equations of the type $$
	X(t,\omega)=H(t,\omega)+\int\_{[0,t)}F(s,\omega,X(\omega))dY(s,\omega)
	$$
	Where $X$ is an unknown $\\mathbb{R}^{d}$-valued process.$Y$ is an $\\mathbb{R}^{m}$-valued cadlag semimartingale and $H$ is an $\mathbb{R}^{d}$-valued adapted cadlag process, both given.The coefficient $F(t,\omega,\eta)$ is a $d\times m$-matrix valued function of the time $t$, the sample point $\omega$ and the cadlag path $\eta$.\\
  First we consider some examples. Then we will sutdy the so-called *It√¥ equations*,that is, equations of the type $$X\_{t}=\xi+\int\_{0}^{t}b(s,X\_{x})ds+\int\_{0}^{t}\sigma(s,X\_{s})dB\_{s}$$ and state existence and uniqueness theorems.\\
  The last section is about the more general semimartingale equation, and also existence and uniqueness resuls. This last section is more technical and the proof are quite long.\\
