This is the second of the notes about Directed Polymers.We talk about the
Markov Property of the Polymer Measure. Also, we define the important notion
of free energy, $p\_{n}(\beta):=\frac{1}{n}log(Z\_{n})$.
We prove the existence of the limit $p(\beta)=\lim_{n\to \infty}p\_{n}(\beta)$,
 and obtain a basic bound,$p(\beta)\leq \lambda(\beta)$,called the
 "annealed bound".\

After that, we improve the annealed bound.Finally, obtain a phase transition
that distinguish between the cases $\lambda(\beta)=p(\beta)$ and
 $p(\beta)<\lambda(\beta)$.
