This fourth part of the stochastic calculus series is about the general stochastic Integral with respect to predictable processes.The aim of this chapter is to define the integral $$\int_{0}^{t}X(s)dY(s)$$ where $Y$ is  a cadlag semimartingale, and $X$ is a locally bounded predictable process.As previous steps, we construct also the integral with respect to $L^{2}-$martingales and local $L^{2}-$martingales.In this chapter it's used several resuls from past parts. For example if it appears 'from lemma 1.23 from chapter 2', you have to look at part 2 from this series.
