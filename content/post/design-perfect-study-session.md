Today I'm going to post a Homework that I have to write
for the English classes that I'm taking in the university,
because I think that it may help someone there. It's about
study habits, and there I describe some tools that may help
you to obtain the best results.\
##  <p>   Design a perfect study session.
<p> In mathematics, you need to dedicate a lot of hours to study if you want to master difficult topics (as far as you are a genius), so it is important to use these study sessions in the most profitable way. In addition, you do not want to spend all your life working. Therefore, it is crucial to make the most of your working hours, in such a way you can spend your free time in whatever you want. To do this, I am going to show you the best tools to create your perfect study session, and thus succeed in your career.
<p> First, you should plan exactly which topics are going to include in your study cycle, and ideally, how much time will last. This will prevent you to procrastinate, and after you finish, you can analyze if your performance was good or not. In my case, I use OneNote to plan the activities that I’m going to do each day, so I don’t have to spend willpower after deciding what’s next.\
<p>Second, prepare the environment where you are going to study, in order that maximizes your concentration. Find a quiet place to study. This includes a library for example (avoid crowded places!). Also, you should avert distractions like social media, email, and even the internet if necessary. Bring with you your favorite music and if you can afford, a good pair of noise-canceling headphones. It’s one of the best investments if you want to obtain complete focus.\
<p>Before the study session starts, prepare yourself physically and mentally. It’s important that you rested well the previous night. I recommend scheduling your study early in the morning, so you have plenty of stamina and time. A light breakfast and a coffee can boost your energy levels, and some physical exercise will carry blood to your brain. Finally, you could try some meditation. Several studies (Chan, 2007) have shown that daily meditations improve cognitive abilities, so you could give a try. Of course, you do not have to do all these activities, but they may help you to obtain the most benefits.\
<P>The final step is the execution of the plan. One recommendation is work in fixed intervals, followed by short breaks. For example, work for one hour, and rest ten minutes. Try to find the best ratio for you. This is important because productivity tends to decay over time, and what you want to obtain the maximum output. To attain the best results, here I share you some tips from Cal Newport (Newport, 2007). One tip is don’t read your material passively. Instead, try to explain with your own words the key concepts, and play with toy examples that and help you understand the topics. This will save you precious hours. Another advice is taking notes while you are reading. This will prevent that you fall asleep while reading and having a summary will avoid you to read all the materials again if you need to do in the future.\
<p>	We have seen that the main steps to designing your perfect study cycle are preparation and scheduling, find the best location and avoid distractions, prepare yourself, and execute the plan in an optimum way.  If you accomplished the above steps, you will be better prepared for your exam or homework. In addition, you won’t waste time studying inefficiently, so you can dispose of more free time to do whatever you want. As a final suggestion, I recommend notifying the people close to you in advance that you won’t be available during your study session to avoid possible distractions. Also, be flexible with your plan. It has not to be perfect, and some unexpected events may happen. But don’t worry, any plan is better than no plan.\
