After almost two months without publishing new stuff, it's time to come back. One of the main reasons for this is that I was preparing for an oral exam that every math Ph.D. student in my university has to pass to start with his thesis. And yes, I passed!.  I would talk about this experience so that people who have to take this kind of test can succeed.\\
First I would like to describe the structure of the exam. It consists of two parts. The first one is an oral exam itself, that is, a committee of professors asks you questions from a syllabus. In my case, this was chosen by myself and my advisor.  The topics included Real Analysis and Probability Theory. This part of the exam lasted one hour. The committee was formed by the professors Manuel Cabezas, Gregorio Moreno, Mircea Petrache and Alejandro Ram√≠rez (advisor). Personally, this was the toughest part of the exam. I was quite nervous the previous days because I wanted to pass on the first try. The questions were the following:\\
Explain the relationship between the Hille-Yosida theorem with probability: This was the first question, and this is one of my weak points, so I state the result and little more. Then they asked me to explain what is the infinitesimal generator and to give the example of Brownian motion. Finally, they asked if I knew what happens when you impose border conditions to the Brownian motion.

The second question was about the relationship of the infinitesimal generator and PDEs. I don't' remember very well the statement and my answer, it was neither very good nor bad.

The third question was about Analysis. More specifically,  they asked me about Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces, the differences between them and to show that $L^{1}$ is not a Hilbert space (this can be proven by the fact that a Banach space is Hilbert if and only if satisfies the parallelogram identity). Also, they asked me to give a counterexample of a Banach space where the unit ball is not compact. I think that I answered well this.

The fourth question was show the Weierstrass theorem. I knew very well that because there is a well known probabilistic proof using Bernstein's polynomials.

The fifth question was about the local time of the Brownian motion and in which dimensions this can be defined. I explained some basic ideas, but I couldn't tell why this only can be possible in dimension one.

The sixth question was to apply Ito's formula to obtain the moments of the powers of the Brownian motion and compute the fourth moment explicitly.

The seventh question was about the Hahn-Banach theorem and an application of the separation theorem.  I had some troubles with the geometric aspects of the exercise, but finally, I could solve this.

The eighth question was a probability theory exercise. I was asked to prove that if we have a sequence of independent random variables, and Z is a random variable measurable with respect to the tail-sigma algebra, then it is almost surely constant.  I knew very well this problem too.

The ninth problem was to state the Girsanov theorem. I knew the theorem, but I had some explications with the interpretation using Radon-Nykodim derivatives.

The final question was to state the different notion of convergence and the relationship between them. This was an easy one.\\
This concludes the oral examination part. After that, I had to give a one-hour presentation about the topics that I am interested in doing research. I talked about random walks in random environment (RWRE) and directed polymers.\\
After the presentation, I went out of the classroom and waited some minutes to receive the answer. I was confident that I would pass the exam, and fortunately, it was.\\
This is my experience with oral examinations. I felt frightened because it was my first (and I hope the last) evaluation of this type, and I didn't know which kind of questions the professors would make me. But overall, it was an instance to learn and relearn different topics, so now I feel that I know more than some months ago.\\
I hope this post can help students that are in a similar situation that I was some weeks ago. I concluded that after all, it wasn't so terrible as I expected, but you don't know that until you experience that.\\
In the next weeks I expect to continue posting regularly about topics in probability and related subjects.
