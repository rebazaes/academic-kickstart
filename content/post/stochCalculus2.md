This second part of the stochastic calculus series is about martingales.This chapter includes basic result such as optional stopping,Doob inequality, local martingales and semimartingales.\\
Finally, the space of martingales is defined, and is proved that is space is complete under the natural metric. Most of these results will be used in subsequent chapters.
