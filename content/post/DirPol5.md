This is the fifth part of the notes about Directed Polymers in Random Environment. In this section, we
study the so called *localized phase*.The key theorem in this section is the following:\
**Theorem:** Assume $d=1$ or $2$. Then for all $\beta\not=0$, the polymer is localized.\
To prove this, one have to check that for every $\beta>0,p(\beta)<\lambda(\beta)$. In the notes is proves the weaker result that $W\_{\infty}=0$ for all $\beta>0$.  Therein also are the references for the full proof of the theorem.\
In the next post I will begin a new series about stochastic calculus, beginning with
some review of stochastic processes and martingales.\
